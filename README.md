# Pick Locale String

Unlike many common programming languages, JavaScript does not have a built-in date formatter. The closest alternative is `toLocaleString`, which formats dates according to different country cultures.

For example, to achieve the format _yyyy-M-d_, you can use `ja-JP`, which produces _2025/1/2_. To get a 24-hour format like _15:04:05_, use `en-GB`. To mimic the format _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_, you can use `lt-LT`. ✈️

Different country cultures provide different formats. By selecting the appropriate locale, you can achieve the desired date format.
