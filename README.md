# Pick Locale String

Unlike many common programming languages, JavaScript doesn't come with a built-in date formatter. Instead, it offers `toLocaleString`, which lets you format dates according to various cultural norms. 🌏

For instance, if you want the format _yyyy-M-d_, you can use `ja-JP`, which will give you _2025/1/2_. Need a 24-hour format like _15:04:05_? Just go with `en-GB`. And if you're aiming for _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_, `lt-LT` has got your back.

Different locales, different strokes! By picking the right locale, you can get the date format you desire. It's like having a personal date stylist for your code. ✈️
